# Student-Performance-Predictor
My first GitHub project : A simple ML-powered Flask app that predicts student performance using study data, SSI scoring, and shows recommendations with analytics.
# How to Run:
Clone this repository, navigate into the project folder, and install the required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt. 
Then start the Flask app by running python app.py and open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the Student Performance Prediction System.
